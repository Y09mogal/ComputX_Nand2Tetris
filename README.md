# ComputX_Nand2Tetris
Implementation of a complete computer from Nand gates on up as described in the book,
"The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken. This book along with course desription and materials required to get start with is available on [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). With the help of this course, one can build a mordern computer which can run various programs like Tetris game by using simple elementary building blocks - Nand Gates.

## Project X Description:
-**Project 4**: This project aims to give us an idea of low level programming in machine language, HACK assembly language and the hardware lying underneath. This contains solution of two programming excercises which is - algebraic program (Mult.asm) & interactive program (Fill.asm).

-**Project 5**: The aim of this project is to ultimately make the HACK Computer with help of construction of the HACK CPU and HACK Hardware platfrom.

-**Project 6**: This project aims to build an assembler which translates symbolic HACK assembly language code to binary which is later tested on the HACK computer that was built in _Project 5_.
